SUMMARY:Building apps that run everywhere with HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, a
 nd Apache Cordova
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Jonathan Stark (Jonathan Stark Consulting). It’
 s a fact: if you have a working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
 you already have the tools you need to develop your own web or hybrid ap
 ps for mobile. In this session, you’ll learn how to use these open sourc
 e web technologies to design and build apps for the iPhone, iPad, Androi
 d, etc. on the development platform of your choice—without using Objecti
 ve-C, Swift, or Java.

SUMMARY:Don't change languages. Change your language.
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Damian Conway (Thoughtstream). Your favorite de
 velopment language may be great, but it inevitably has a few misfeatures
  that make every programming task unnecessarily harder. That doesn't mea
 n you need to find a new language; you can fix your existing one. And, h
 appily, you already have exactly the right tool to do that: your existin
 g language.

SUMMARY:Open source data science with NoSQL and R
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Nicole White (Neo4j). Most data scientists will
  tell you they spend a greater percent of their time munging data than t
 hey do building predictive models. In this session, learn how to spend l
 ess time writing queries and more time building models, by combining the
  flexibility of a NoSQL graph database with R—an open source statistical
  programming language—to analyze Twitter data in a reproducible, low-eff
 ort workflow.

SUMMARY:Handle your design conundrums with modern Python design patterns
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Anna Martelli Ravenscroft (Self), Alex Martelli
  (Google). Many classic design patterns and traditional Python idioms re
 main relevant today. However, the language has grown, the problem spaces
  we address keep shifting, and best practices for software development h
 ave matured. Thus, the set of best-of-breed patterns and idioms has chan
 ged, some classics fading, new stars emerging. This talk explores today'
 s realities in Python patterns and idioms.

SUMMARY:Beyond messaging: Enterprise dataflow with Apache NiFi
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Joe Witt (Onyara Inc.). Dataflow is an often un
 derestimated challenge in realizing the value of big data. Messaging-bas
 ed approaches are fast and well understood, and solid open source option
 s exist. However, this talk makes the case that transport-oriented messa
 ging is not the right abstraction for large distributed enterprise data 
 flow, and describes how Apache NiFi is designed to solve these problems.

SUMMARY:Space, time, and state
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Amy Palamountain (GitHub). Reactive programming
  is the trendy new way to build desktop and mobile apps. Reacting to use
 r input over time can prove to be difficult, because of the enormous amo
 unt of state we need to keep track of. In this talk we will discover how
  to improve our reactive applications by removing the need for state ent
 irely. This allows us to clearly reason about, and react to, user input 
 over time.

SUMMARY:Telling your story: Speaking for non-speakers
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Kirsten Hunter (Akamai). Many conference attend
 ees come year after year without giving presentations.  The sense that t
 here's a high bar for perfection is pervasive, and people are afraid of 
 being "wrong."  Everyone has a story to tell about a problem they've sol
 ved or issues they've tackled.  Learn how to share your experiences with
 out fear, and join the speaker community!

DESCRIPTION:Presented by Nicolas Steenhout (Part of a Whole). Without fi
 rsthand experience, it is difficult to understand the barriers that exis
 t for screenreader users on the web. Many developers have told me they w
 ere curious to "see" a screenreader in action. This is your chance! Usin
 g a combination of real-world examples and code snippets, we will use a 
 screenreader to go through common barriers and discuss them.

SUMMARY:Constructive conflict resolution
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Donna Benjamin (Creative Contingencies), Gina L

 ing them with alternatives is a useful process. But it can be uncomforta
 ble and confronting for many people. Let's discuss how we can build a cu
 lture of respect to embrace the positive aspects of conflict and work to

SUMMARY:AngularJS tutorial
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Sam Helman (Flatiron Health). AngularJS is rela

 to walk you through building a basic app, and introduce you to concepts 
 and patterns that will allow you to comfortably dive further into using 
 AngularJS.

SUMMARY:Nobody should know more about you than you do
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Alistair Croll (Solve For Interesting). In the

 is session, Alistair Croll looks at the promises and perils of big data 
 as it finds its way into our lives, and makes far too many unreasonable 
 predictions along the way.

DESCRIPTION:Presented by Peter Hoddie (Marvell). The Internet of Things 
 is built on open source software, and yet the devices are far from open.
  This isn’t the future that free and open source contributors have been 
 working toward. It's a disappointment for the Open Source Community, but
  we can lead the way to freedom, transparency, and collaboration in IoT.
  And we must—to avert impending frustration for increasingly savvy consu

SUMMARY:Development, testing, acceptance and production with Docker and 
 Kubernetes
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Patrick Reilly (Kismatic, Inc.). Docker runs yo
 ur code in a container, which is like a lightweight VM. A container runs
  your code directly on the host operating system and hardware, but in an
  isolated userspace. This way, you get all the isolation and consistency
  benefits of a VM, but with very little overhead. If you run your code o
 n top of Linux in production, then Docker is for you pair this with Kube
 rnetes and you're all set.

SUMMARY:Introduction to reactive programming: Hands-on with Akka, Java, 
 and Scala (continued)
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Duncan DeVore (Typesafe), Henrik Engstrom (Type
 safe). Reactive programming represents a paradigm shift in the way we re
 ason about system design by embracing the fundamentals of distributed co
 mputing. It is this paradigm shift that in turn allows us to build appli
 cations that "react" to environment changes such as failure and increase
 d load through "self-healing" and elastic scaling.
