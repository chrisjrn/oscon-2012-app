Unfortunately, the root causes of many problems occur at a fine granularity that existing continuous profiling and direct measurement approaches cannot observe. This paper presents the design and implementation of SHIM, a continuous profiler that samples at resolutions as fine as 15 cycles; three to five orders of magnitude finer than current continuous profilers. SHIM\u2019s fine-grain measurements reveal new behaviors, such as variations in instructions per cycle (IPC) within the execution of a single function. A SHIM observer thread executes and samples autonomously on unutilized hardware. To sample, it reads hardware performance counters and memory locations that store software state. SHIM improves its accuracy by automatically detecting and discarding samples affected by measurement skew. We measure SHIM\u2019s observer effects and show how to analyze them. When on a separate core, SHIM can continuously observe one software signal with a 2% overhead at a ~1200 cycle resolution. At an overhead of 61%, SHIM samples one software signal on the same core with SMT at a ~15 cycle resolution. Modest hardware changes could significantly reduce overheads and add greater analytical capability to SHIM. We vary prefetching and DVFS policies in case studies that show the diagnostic power of fine-grain IPC and memory bandwidth results.

Internationalization support varies greatly by language, because each language needs particular features that may or may not work properly. One of the most challenging problems in language support is dealing with languages that are right-to-left, and the 500 million speakers of RTL languages often find themselves at the very bottom of the heap.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the support of those languages \u2013 on Linux, other operating systems, and on the Web \u2013 is so abysmal that it is hard to find a single piece of software that properly supports all the necessary behaviors.\r\n\r\nThe effect of right-to-left languages extends beyond the writing and reading of the script. The direction of reading has a significant psychological effect \u2013 where your eyes shift on the screen, your expectations of where interface elements should be, and what you expect when typing in a bi-directional setting.\r\n\r\nThe issues become even more complicated in an environment that handles bi-directionality. The questions of how systems should behave when two languages of two different directions interact become almost mind boggling. And yet, these are behaviors that right-to-left users encounter on a regular basis, and the solutions that are offered today prove to be extremely lacking. \r\n\r\nIn this presentation, I will cover some critical aspects that right-to-left users run into when dealing with software and websites, and potential solutions that are available, while concentrating on what developers should look out for and remember when they consider support for RTL languages.

Engaging students, involving parents, inspiring teachers. Un-boring kids! What is its approach, and why is it working?\r\n\r\nIt's not about the tools. Just like we cannot \"sell\" Linux to a desktop user by arguing that \"it's better\", resources typically don't get adopted for their openness. We all know numerous examples proving this. Rather, the initial reasons for adoption tend to be different ones, and the openness is either a nice bonus or something that can be discussed later. Whatever works, right?\r\n\r\nOther aspects of open resources provide a variety of opportunities. They might enable a poorer school to acquire more hands-on gear for their students. They might provide a busy teacher with more suitable resources, quicker, and kept up-to-date. They might allow students to explore a topic or skill in an engaging way that other (proprietary) resources have not made possible, such as turning a previous \"tool\" into an object of significant learning in itself.\r\n\r\nDozens of senior primary kids (and their teachers, and some parents!) learn how to solder every month, know the difference between a servo and a stepper motor, year 5 students talk and write programs in mnemonics, and that's just a few examples.\r\n\r\nAnd it's not just in the realm of Maths, Science and Technology.

There are also projects like esp-open-rtos aiming to strip back layers of proprietary code to produce a more programmer friendly development environment.\r\n\r\nThe ESP8266 exemplifies a trend towards cheap ubiquitous hardware, a building block for the much-hyped \"Internet of Things\". It's also a product of the hugely competitive world of low end Chinese manufacturing - related to the \"gongkai\" notion of information sharing. By looking at ESP8266 we can find clues about how low end connected hardware is likely to evolve, and what that means for people who care about software freedom and hardware openness.\r\n\r\nComing away from this talk you'll hopefully have gained some inspiration for projects you might build with an ESP8266, and knowledge of the open source based frameworks you could use.

It is low cost and low power, extensible and open and leverages the reliability of the Linux OS and open source video player applications. Having access to the source code allows museums to leverage the work of the 1000's of great minds who contribute to the development of the technology stack, to modify the code to incorporate new custom features, to contribute those changes back for the benefit of the global cultural heritage community and to obtain support from peers and others in the community with knowledge of the base OS and popular powerful open source languages such as Python.

As the technology evolves, for example in the recent transition to IP-based broadcast, the needs of the market are continuously fluctuating. In order to successfully meet those needs, the key values to adhere to are openness, flexibility and interoperability. Our approach describes a Linux-based video broadcasting system that is built around these values.\r\n\r\nWe are greatly aided in this effort by the GStreamer framework. GStreamer is an open source pipeline-based multimedia framework, with pipelines dynamically constructed out of small composable components in a greater hierarchy.  GStreamer's open and flexible nature enables us to easily support multiple types of input and output, therefore enhancing interoperability while still relying on open standards. Furthermore, its GL extensions enables us to  use a cross-platform abstraction layer for GPU-accelerated video processing. Another important aspect in our use case is the ability GStreamer gives us to dynamically and seamlessly change the pipeline, adding and removing inputs and outputs as it runs without interrupting already running inputs or outputs.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we demonstrate the use of GStreamer in a distributed IP-based production environment, which still also support SDI inputs and outputs. It is location independent, meaning that several physically isolated pipelines can nicely work together over the network while still keeping synchronization.  Network synchronization is achieved by leveraging open standards like PTP, RTP/RTSP, which also allows interoperability with third party solutions.\r\n\r\nWe explain the architecture of our product and show the range of input and output types supported - for example, Decklink and URI (file or network) inputs can be combined, and the output can be shown locally, written to a file and also redirected to an RTSP server.

GlusterD is the daemon which manages the cluster configuration for Gluster.\r\n\r\nFor more information about Gluster please refer to http://www.gluster.org/\r\n\r\nWhat is Big-lock in GlusterD:\r\n------------------------------------\r\n\r\nGlusterD was originally designed as a single threaded application which\r\ncould handle just one transaction at a time. It was made multi-threaded to\r\nimprove responsiveness and support handling multiple transactions at a\r\ntime. This was needed for newer features like volume snapshots which could\r\nleave GlusterD unresponsive for some periods of time.\r\n\r\nMaking GlusterD multi-threaded required the creation of a thread\r\nsynchronization mechanism, to protect the shared data-structures (mainly\r\neverything under the GlusterD configuration, glusterd_conf_t struct) from\r\nconcurrent access from multiple threads. This was accomplished using the\r\nBig-lock.\r\n\r\nThe Big-lock is an exclusive lock, so any threads which needs to use the\r\nprotected data need to obtain the Big-lock and give up the Big-lock once\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nProblem with Big-lock\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nThe Big-lock synchronization solution was added into the GlusterD code to\r\nsolve problems that arose when GlusterD was made multi-threaded. This was\r\nsupposed to be a quick solution, to allow GlusterD to be shipped.\r\n\r\nBig-lock as the name suggests, is a coarse grained lock. The coarseness of\r\nthe lock leads to threads contending even when they are accessing unrelated\r\ndata, which lead to some deadlocks.\r\n\r\nOne example of this deadlock is with transactions and RPC. If a thread\r\nholding the Big-lock blocked on network I/O it may result in a deadlock.\r\nThis could happen when the remote endpoint is disconnected. The callback\r\ncode would be executed in the same thread that has acquired the Big-lock.\r\nAll network I/O handlers, including callbacks, are implemented to acquire\r\nthe Big-lock before executing. From the above two, we have a deadlock.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this, we release the Big-lock whenever a thread could block on\r\nnetwork I/O. This comes with a price. This opens up a window of time when\r\nthe shared data structures are prone to updates leading to inconsistencies.\r\n\r\nThe Big-lock, in its current state, doesn\u2019t even fully satisfy the problem\r\nit set out to solve, and has more problems on top of that. These problems\r\nare only going to grow with new features and new code being added to\r\nGlusterD.\r\n\r\nPossible solutions\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nThe most obvious solution would be to split up the Big-lock into more fine\r\ngrained locks. We could go one step further and use replace the mutex locks\r\n(Big-lock is a mutex lock), with readers-writer locks. This will bring in\r\nmore flexibility and fine grained control, at the cost of additional\r\noverheads mainly in the complexity of implementation.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative to readers-writer locks, we propose to use RCU as the\r\nsynchronization mechanism. RCU provides several advantages above\r\nreaders-writer locks while providing similar synchronization features.\r\nThese advantages make it more preferable to readers-writer locks, even\r\nthough the implementation complexity remains nearly the same for both\r\napproaches.\r\n\r\nRead-copy-update (RCU)\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\nRCU, short for Read-Copy-Update, is a synchronization mechanism that can be\r\nused as an alternative to reader-writer locks.\r\n\r\nA good introduction to RCU can be found in this series of articles on LWN\r\n[1] and [2]. The articles are with respect to the usage of RCU in the\r\nLinux kernel, where it is used heavily.\r\n\r\nThe advantages that make RCU preferable to RWlocks are the following,\r\n\r\n- Wait free reads\r\nRCU readers have no wait overhead. They can never be blocked by writers.\r\nRCU readers need to notify when they are in their critical sections, but\r\nthis notification is much lighter than locks.\r\n\r\n- Provides existence guarantees\r\nRCU guarantees that RCU protected data in a readers critical section will\r\nremain in existence till the end of the critical section. This is achieved\r\nby having the writers work on a copy of the data, instead of using the\r\nexisting data.\r\n\r\n- Concurrent readers and writers\r\nWait-free reads and the existence guarantee mean that it is possible to\r\nhave readers and writers in concurrent execution. Any readers in execution,\r\nbefore a writer starts will continue working with the original copy of the\r\ndata. The writer will work on a copy, and will use RCU methods to\r\nswap/replace original data without affecting existing readers. Any readers\r\ncoming online after the writer will see the new data.\r\nThis does mean that some readers will continue to work with stale data,\r\nbut this isn't too big a problem as the data at least remains consistent\r\ntill the reader finishes.\r\n\r\n- Read-side deadlock immunity\r\nRCU readers always run in a deterministic time as they never block. This\r\nmeans that they can never become a part of a deadlock.\r\n\r\n- No writer starvation\r\nAs RCU readers don't block, writers can never starve.\r\n\r\nUserspace RCU\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nThe kernel uses features provided by the processor to implement its RCU.\r\nUserspace applications cannot make use of these features, but instead can\r\nuse the Userspace RCU library.\r\n\r\nliburcu [3] provides a userspace implementation of RCU, which is\r\nportable across multiple platforms and operating systems. liburcu also\r\nprovides some common data structures and RCU protected APIs to use them.\r\n\r\nAn introduction to URCU and its APIs can be found in this article on LWN\r\n[4].\r\n\r\n[1]: https://lwn.net/Articles/262464/\r\n[2]: https://lwn.net/Articles/263130/\r\n[3]: http://urcu.so/\r\n[4]: https://lwn.net/Articles/573424/\r\n", "Title": "Improving thread synchronization in GlusterD (Daemon for Gluster) using Userspace RCU (Read-copy-update)", "URL": "http://linux.conf.au/schedule/30007/view_talk", "Event": 31, "Start": "2016-02-03 13:20:00", "Presenter_emails": "amukherj@redhat.com", "Presenters": "Atin Mukherjee", "Duration": "0:45:00", "Id": 77, "video_release": "True", "Room Name": "Wool Museum"}, {"Description": "The Bourne shell is universally available on every Linux system, from the least-powerful embedded device, to the largest supercomputer.\r\nIn this tutorial, we'll cover the basics of:\r\nThe Shell's input: how it reads words, splits them, expands special stuff, etc.\r\nControl flow: case, if, while, for\r\nCommon utilities: sed, awk, grep, test, find, xargs, etc\r\n\r\nAfter some introductory material, we'll spend the time working together to build a simple server for fortunes/fables entirely in shell.\r\nTo see the result, do\r\n  telnet lemon.ertos.nicta.com.au 8500\r\n\r\nYou will need to bring a laptop with you to do the exercises.

In both cases these bugs were found using the latest fuzzing tools, one of them being American Fuzzy Lop (AFL). Using AFL the presenter then found and fixed numerous other bugs in these two projects.\r\n\r\nThen, in early 2015, as part of the Snowden relevations, the SSH protocol and/or common implementations like OpenSSH were briefly suspected of containing a flaw that was known only to the NSA. Fortunately this suspicion quickly fell out of favour but how can we know for sure that the NSA doesn't have an exploit for OpenSSH?\r\n\r\nThis open question led the presenter to try to figure out how to fuzz encrypted network protolcols like SSH. For OpenSSH, it turns out to be rather difficult but that is mainly a design flaw in OpenSSH itself.

Free and open source licenses are necessary in education, whether the learners are millions of primary school students in India or a vocational training class of twelve in North Carolina. The tools needed to meet these demands cannot exist or thrive without the practical and philosophical benefits of free and open source licenses.\r\n\r\nThese licenses are not only pragmatically useful for an individual platform, but necessary for future development. In order to educate a global population, resources, tools, and content must not only be adaptive and versatile, but also accessible, changeable, and shareable.\r\n\r\nUnder the lofty goal of \u201creaching a billion students,\u201d MOOC provider edX opened up their code base in 2013, releasing it under the AGPL.

Each factor gives us an opportunity to consider avoidable anti-patterns if you\u2019re using containers to deploy and manage repeatable, reliable, and portable services.\r\n \r\nContainers rose in popularity on an oft used metaphor: lightweight virtual machines. We have a robust understanding of the benefits of virtualized hardware as a method of efficient resource utilization. The idea of _even more efficient_ resource utilization makes sense. Unfortunately it\u2019s a problematic metaphor.\r\n \r\nContainers represent a constrained set of capabilities compared to virtual machines in order to make fine-grained guarantees about resource constraints and process isolation. This is a good thing. There is overlap in ideal capabilities between VMs and containers but it isn\u2019t complete. Newcomers to the container ecosystem begin with a \u201clightweight VM\u201d understanding and fall victim to specific anti-patterns.\r\n \r\nAfter this talk you\u2019ll understand common pitfalls in containerization and how you can avoid them.

Topics will include an overview of the most significant security flaws discovered over the last year in popular cloud platforms, the generic foundations of advance persistent threats, and some of the recent countermeasures of encryption, key management, and platform validation being introduced into OpenStack and Hadoop. A demo of Trusted Compute Pools will also be given and an explanation of what types of advanced threats it protects against will be provided.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that, despite the exponential growth in security products, security services, security companies, security certifications, and general interest in the security topic; we are still bombarded with a constant parade of security vulnerability disclosures on a seemingly daily basis. Knowing that complete protection from threats and vulnerabilities at the front end of the infrastructure is impossible and that advanced threats will find their way past our defenses, efforts to protect the data and the \u2018keys to the castle\u2019 being the last line of defense are even more critical.\r\n\r\nThe hardware enabling \u2018trusted computing\u2019 is referred to as a Trusted Platform Module (TPM), and is designed as a commodity chip that is integrated into motherboards, as well as appliances such as network switches, firewalls, and embedded devices. The TPM provides features that are useful in providing assurances about the state of a platform and protecting sensitive information. Essentially, the chip can be used to generate, store, and protect encryption keys. It also provides a mechanism to store information about the state of a platform through a traceable, cryptographic mechanism, which can be securely attested to a remote verifier. TPMs have been around for a while but have had a slow uptake in actual use until recently due to initial privacy concerns that have been mostly overcome. Many cloud deployments include hardware with a TPM, but it is rarely used. Championed by Intel and others, support for using the TPM and related Intel TXT to provide remote attestation has been included in OpenStack in the form of Trusted Compute Pools. This feature can detect systems within the cloud that have booted untrusted code and block guests from executing on them. This will be demo\u2019ed on a live system. Of course, this boot time detection of untrusted code is beneficial, there are other ways a TPM could be utilized to better protect user or application data via strong and cheap protection of keys. Work being done in OpenStack to utilize the TPM for key protection will also be discussed. In addition, when configuring bare metal systems, there are many other ways to use the TPM such as with the IMA/EVM subsystem or by using the TPM to protect keys used in disk encryption, applications, or user data. Some of the common tools for using TPMs on bare metal systems will be enumerated. Lastly, although not necessarily a \u2018cloud\u2019 platform, Hadoop is a mainstay in the related field of big data. Until recently, the lack of block level encryption has been an issue for organizations looking to protect Hadoop data. We will discuss the architecture of the Hadoop encryption framework and considerations for key protection.
