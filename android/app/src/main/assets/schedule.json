GlusterD is the daemon which manages the cluster configuration for Gluster.\r\n\r\nFor more information about Gluster please refer to http://www.gluster.org/\r\n\r\nWhat is Big-lock in GlusterD:\r\n------------------------------------\r\n\r\nGlusterD was originally designed as a single threaded application which\r\ncould handle just one transaction at a time. It was made multi-threaded to\r\nimprove responsiveness and support handling multiple transactions at a\r\ntime. This was needed for newer features like volume snapshots which could\r\nleave GlusterD unresponsive for some periods of time.\r\n\r\nMaking GlusterD multi-threaded required the creation of a thread\r\nsynchronization mechanism, to protect the shared data-structures (mainly\r\neverything under the GlusterD configuration, glusterd_conf_t struct) from\r\nconcurrent access from multiple threads. This was accomplished using the\r\nBig-lock.\r\n\r\nThe Big-lock is an exclusive lock, so any threads which needs to use the\r\nprotected data need to obtain the Big-lock and give up the Big-lock once\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nProblem with Big-lock\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nThe Big-lock synchronization solution was added into the GlusterD code to\r\nsolve problems that arose when GlusterD was made multi-threaded. This was\r\nsupposed to be a quick solution, to allow GlusterD to be shipped.\r\n\r\nBig-lock as the name suggests, is a coarse grained lock. The coarseness of\r\nthe lock leads to threads contending even when they are accessing unrelated\r\ndata, which lead to some deadlocks.\r\n\r\nOne example of this deadlock is with transactions and RPC. If a thread\r\nholding the Big-lock blocked on network I/O it may result in a deadlock.\r\nThis could happen when the remote endpoint is disconnected. The callback\r\ncode would be executed in the same thread that has acquired the Big-lock.\r\nAll network I/O handlers, including callbacks, are implemented to acquire\r\nthe Big-lock before executing. From the above two, we have a deadlock.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this, we release the Big-lock whenever a thread could block on\r\nnetwork I/O. This comes with a price. This opens up a window of time when\r\nthe shared data structures are prone to updates leading to inconsistencies.\r\n\r\nThe Big-lock, in its current state, doesn\u2019t even fully satisfy the problem\r\nit set out to solve, and has more problems on top of that. These problems\r\nare only going to grow with new features and new code being added to\r\nGlusterD.\r\n\r\nPossible solutions\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nThe most obvious solution would be to split up the Big-lock into more fine\r\ngrained locks. We could go one step further and use replace the mutex locks\r\n(Big-lock is a mutex lock), with readers-writer locks. This will bring in\r\nmore flexibility and fine grained control, at the cost of additional\r\noverheads mainly in the complexity of implementation.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative to readers-writer locks, we propose to use RCU as the\r\nsynchronization mechanism. RCU provides several advantages above\r\nreaders-writer locks while providing similar synchronization features.\r\nThese advantages make it more preferable to readers-writer locks, even\r\nthough the implementation complexity remains nearly the same for both\r\napproaches.\r\n\r\nRead-copy-update (RCU)\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\nRCU, short for Read-Copy-Update, is a synchronization mechanism that can be\r\nused as an alternative to reader-writer locks.\r\n\r\nA good introduction to RCU can be found in this series of articles on LWN\r\n[1] and [2]. The articles are with respect to the usage of RCU in the\r\nLinux kernel, where it is used heavily.\r\n\r\nThe advantages that make RCU preferable to RWlocks are the following,\r\n\r\n- Wait free reads\r\nRCU readers have no wait overhead. They can never be blocked by writers.\r\nRCU readers need to notify when they are in their critical sections, but\r\nthis notification is much lighter than locks.\r\n\r\n- Provides existence guarantees\r\nRCU guarantees that RCU protected data in a readers critical section will\r\nremain in existence till the end of the critical section. This is achieved\r\nby having the writers work on a copy of the data, instead of using the\r\nexisting data.\r\n\r\n- Concurrent readers and writers\r\nWait-free reads and the existence guarantee mean that it is possible to\r\nhave readers and writers in concurrent execution. Any readers in execution,\r\nbefore a writer starts will continue working with the original copy of the\r\ndata. The writer will work on a copy, and will use RCU methods to\r\nswap/replace original data without affecting existing readers. Any readers\r\ncoming online after the writer will see the new data.\r\nThis does mean that some readers will continue to work with stale data,\r\nbut this isn't too big a problem as the data at least remains consistent\r\ntill the reader finishes.\r\n\r\n- Read-side deadlock immunity\r\nRCU readers always run in a deterministic time as they never block. This\r\nmeans that they can never become a part of a deadlock.\r\n\r\n- No writer starvation\r\nAs RCU readers don't block, writers can never starve.\r\n\r\nUserspace RCU\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nThe kernel uses features provided by the processor to implement its RCU.\r\nUserspace applications cannot make use of these features, but instead can\r\nuse the Userspace RCU library.\r\n\r\nliburcu [3] provides a userspace implementation of RCU, which is\r\nportable across multiple platforms and operating systems. liburcu also\r\nprovides some common data structures and RCU protected APIs to use them.\r\n\r\nAn introduction to URCU and its APIs can be found in this article on LWN\r\n[4].\r\n\r\n[1]: https://lwn.net/Articles/262464/\r\n[2]: https://lwn.net/Articles/263130/\r\n[3]: http://urcu.so/\r\n[4]: https://lwn.net/Articles/573424/\r\n", "author": "Atin Mukherjee", "url": "http://linux.conf.au/schedule/30007/view_talk", "raw_description": "Gluster is a open source scalable distributed storage system which can run in any commodity hardware.

In both cases these bugs were found using the latest fuzzing tools, one of them being American Fuzzy Lop (AFL). Using AFL the presenter then found and fixed numerous other bugs in these two projects.\r\n\r\nThen, in early 2015, as part of the Snowden relevations, the SSH protocol and/or common implementations like OpenSSH were briefly suspected of containing a flaw that was known only to the NSA. Fortunately this suspicion quickly fell out of favour but how can we know for sure that the NSA doesn't have an exploit for OpenSSH?\r\n\r\nThis open question led the presenter to try to figure out how to fuzz encrypted network protolcols like SSH.

In both cases these bugs were found using the latest fuzzing tools, one of them being American Fuzzy Lop (AFL). Using AFL the presenter then found and fixed numerous other bugs in these two projects.\r\n\r\nThen, in early 2015, as part of the Snowden relevations, the SSH protocol and/or common implementations like OpenSSH were briefly suspected of containing a flaw that was known only to the NSA. Fortunately this suspicion quickly fell out of favour but how can we know for sure that the NSA doesn't have an exploit for OpenSSH?\r\n\r\nThis open question led the presenter to try to figure out how to fuzz encrypted network protolcols like SSH.

I'll give some demos at the conference.\r\n\r\nThe loudest is a 700 sized petrol helicopter, which turned out to be a\r\nreal challenge for vibration handling, and also had some interesting\r\nissues with IMU filtering.\r\n\r\nThe craziest is the Lohan rocket plane, which aims to fly at supersonic\r\nspeeds 20km above the ground, before doing an autonomous landing at\r\nSpaceport USA (or possibly creating a new crater in the ground nearby!).\r\n\r\nLinux on flying robots is really going mainstream now!", "title": "Helicopters and rocket-planes", "room": "Costa Hall"}, {"start": "2016-02-01 10:40:00+11:00", "end": "2016-02-01 11:00:00+11:00", "description": "Unconference: https://goo.gl/Zszeu6", "author": "Stewart Smith", "url": "http://linux.conf.au/schedule/30384/view_talk", "raw_description": "Unconference: https://goo.gl/Zszeu6", "title": "Kernel Miniconf Introduction and Unconference Planning", "room": "Wool Museum"}, {"start": "2016-02-05 10:40:00+11:00", "end": "2016-02-05 12:20:00+11:00", "description": "Learn eChronos, a newly open-sourced Real Time operating system for MMU-less systems and the Internet of Things!\r\n\r\nIn this tutorial you will learn:\r\n   -- What eChronos is for and good at\r\n   -- How to build a system using eChronos\r\n   -- How to run that system for testing on QEMU\r\n   -- How to deploy the system onto real hardware\r\n\r\nParticipants are expected to understand basic OS concepts and have basic familiarity with the Linux command line.\r\n\r\nSometimes you want to run some very time-critical code on a device that doesn't have a lot of memory.

I will share the lessons I have learned running these workshops, and start a discussion about how we can provide biology training for those with computational and analytic skills wishing to make the transition into bioinformatics.", "title": "Many Roads to Bioinformatics", "room": "D4.303 Costa Theatre"}, {"start": "2016-02-01 11:50:00+11:00", "end": "2016-02-01 12:20:00+11:00", "description": "http://afrubin.github.io/miniconf/", "author": "Adrian Hecker", "url": "http://linux.conf.au/schedule/30303/view_talk", "raw_description": "http://afrubin.github.io/miniconf/", "title": "Microscopium: Interactive clustering of high content screen images", "room": "D4.303 Costa Theatre"}, {"start": "2016-02-01 13:20:00+11:00", "end": "2016-02-01 13:30:00+11:00", "description": "http://afrubin.github.io/miniconf/", "author": "Tony Papenfuss", "url": "http://linux.conf.au/schedule/30304/view_talk", "raw_description": "http://afrubin.github.io/miniconf/", "title": "Message fromthe ABACBS President", "room": "D4.303 Costa Theatre"}, {"start": "2016-02-01 13:30:00+11:00", "end": "2016-02-01 14:00:00+11:00", "description": "http://afrubin.github.io/miniconf/", "author": "David Powell", "url": "http://linux.conf.au/schedule/30305/view_talk", "raw_description": "http://afrubin.github.io/miniconf/", "title": "Building web-based visualization tools to empower biologists", "room": "D4.303 Costa Theatre"}, {"start": "2016-02-01 14:00:00+11:00", "end": "2016-02-01 14:30:00+11:00", "description": "http://afrubin.github.io/miniconf/", "author": "Ken Doig", "url": "http://linux.conf.au/schedule/30306/view_talk", "raw_description": "http://afrubin.github.io/miniconf/", "title": "Production Pathology: from spinning wheels to knitting mills", "room": "D4.303 Costa Theatre"}, {"start": "2016-02-01 14:30:00+11:00", "end": "2016-02-01 15:00:00+11:00", "description": "http://afrubin.github.io/miniconf/", "author": "Belinda Phipson", "url": "http://linux.conf.au/schedule/30307/view_talk", "raw_description": "http://afrubin.github.io/miniconf/", "title": "R and Bioconductor: open source software for analysing genomic data ", "room": "D4.303 Costa Theatre"}, {"start": "2016-02-01 15:40:00+11:00", "end": "2016-02-01 16:10:00+11:00", "description": "http://afrubin.github.io/miniconf/", "author": "Lavinia Gordon", "url": "http://linux.conf.au/schedule/30308/view_talk", "raw_description": "http://afrubin.github.io/miniconf/", "title": "Applied bioinformatics using open source software", "room": "D4.303 Costa Theatre"}, {"start": "2016-02-01 16:10:00+11:00", "end": "2016-02-01 16:50:00+11:00", "description": "http://afrubin.github.io/miniconf/", "author": "Simon Gladman", "url": "http://linux.conf.au/schedule/30309/view_talk", "raw_description": "http://afrubin.github.io/miniconf/", "title": "Building and deploying the Genomics Virtual Laboratory on the cloud(s)- Simon Gladman, Yousef Kowsar, and Andrew Isaac", "room": "D4.303 Costa Theatre"}, {"start": "2016-02-01 16:50:00+11:00", "end": "2016-02-01 17:20:00+11:00", "description": "http://afrubin.github.io/miniconf/", "author": "Torsten Seemann", "url": "http://linux.conf.au/schedule/30310/view_talk", "raw_description": "http://afrubin.github.io/miniconf/", "title": "Sequencing your poo with a USB stick", "room": "D4.303 Costa Theatre"}, {"start": "2016-02-01 10:40:00+11:00", "end": "2016-02-01 11:35:00+11:00", "description": "During the construction of our new house, a proprietary platform for whole-house audio was proposed by our builder.
